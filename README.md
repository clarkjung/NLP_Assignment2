Natural Language Process Assignment 2

Task1: Text Classfication

Calculate the perplexity of the corpus
Split in training (90%) and test (10%) sets
Randomly and per document
Build a language model using the training set (Maximum Likelihood, bigram)
Use Laplace (Add-one) smoothing for the zero probabilities Estimate probabilities on the test set
Task2: Part-of-speech tagging

Calculate precision for the corpus
Split in training (90%) and test (10%) sets
Randomly and per document
Learn the model using the training set (Hidden Markov Model, bigram)
Predict POS tags for the test set
